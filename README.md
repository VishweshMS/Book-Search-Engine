# Book-Search-Engine
The Book Search Engine is an advanced, user-friendly platform designed for users to effortlessly search for books by title or author, presenting a list of relevant results. This project was initially built using the MERN stack and has been enhanced by replacing the existing RESTful API with a more flexible and efficient GraphQL API.
